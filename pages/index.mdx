# What is Goat Slider?
 
Goat Slider allows the **Webflow** community to build sliders within the Webflow Designer panel of all kinds. It easily outperforms some of the Webflow native slider functionalities and brings an easy way to **build**, **manage**, and **ship** **super creative** sliders all for free. Like a 🐐.

## What Is The Documentation For?

The app is relatively new on the market, and it brings some very different approaches to building sliders. While the community needs a clear and easy way to understand its concepts and how to use it in the best way.

While closely listening to the community's desire for documentation on the Goat Slider, we decided to provide a very detailed documentation that covers all aspects of the app.

Based on our calucation this documentation doesn't take more than 30 minutes to read and understand, and this way you become a 🐐 user. And build the most fasionating sliders out there.

## Open Documentation

With the documentation we wanted to take a different approach, and make it public so everyone can add something we might have missed or grammar mistakes that can be improved.
