# Webflow compatible 

We have built the Goat Slider app exclusively for the Webflow platform so its community can find it easier to design and implement sliders on their projects. 

This was possible due to our in-depth knowledge of web design and extensive experience working with the Webflow platform for 5 years, and the Webflow community's pain points and struggles on the other hand. 

Our idea was strict and simple: Add the functionality of the slider and manage it, while Webflow manages the UI and other parts. Meaning, the hover effects, animations, and other states are managed all by Webflow.

## What Can You Do?

The Goat Slider app gives you extra features for designing more powerful and creative sliders. Above the Webflow default features, with the Goat Slider, you can design custom; arrows, points, counters, personalize slider sizes, their states, and everything else. 

The slider doesn't limit you from using variables and everything that Webflow offers, except for some limitations mentioned below.

## What You Can't Do?

### Use On Click Animations & Events

You can't use native on-click animations on the slider area because of an issue with Webflow's animation library that didn't let us manage the scripts in our own way. We had to disable this. But this doesn't mean you can't use other animations, such as in view, on scroll, and other animations that Webflow offers.

### Break Base Layout

As long as the elements of the sliders are inside the main wrapper, everything can be customized. Arrows can be nested 10 elements down and similar for other elements, but not leave the root wrapper.

Yeah that's all, üêê, isn't it?
