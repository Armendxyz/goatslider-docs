# How It Started
 
**Webflow** is a powerful tool for building websites, and the community loves it. However, there was something frustrating that the community wanted to see improved.

Yes, that feature was the **slider**. We saw hundreds of people asking for, and awaiting their savior to come. And here we are writing the documention for the best Webflow app out there.


## Mission

We aim to contribute to the cause of sliders and encourage the Webflow community to appreciate sliders and use them more. With the first version we shipped many features, with more to come in the future. 

Our sole focus is to empower people to build the best, most **performant**, **creative**, and **interactive** sliders ever.
