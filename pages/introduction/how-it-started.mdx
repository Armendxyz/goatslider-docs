# How It Started
 
Webflow is a powerful tool for building websites, and the community loves it. However, there was something frustrating that the community wanted to see improved. Yeah, that feature was the Slider. We noticed countless people seeking a better alternative without custom code. And from this is where we started with the idea to build the best slider solution.

## Mission

We aim to contribute to the cause of sliders and encourage the Webflow community to appreciate sliders and use them more. With the first version we shipped many features, with more to come in the future. 

Our sole focus is to empower people to build the best, most **performant**, **creative**, and **interactive** sliders ever.
