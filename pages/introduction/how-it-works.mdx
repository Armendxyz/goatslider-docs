# Installing Goat Slider

Before anything else, we need to install the app from the Webflow Marketplace. So it will show up on the app explorer in Designer.

We recommend installing it on the workspace level and not at the individual project level, so in this way, all sites will have it installed automatically.

## Starting with the Goat slider

After installing the Goat slider, search for it in the extension section of the Webflow designer, launch it, and start designing a customized slider based on your needs. After you finish it, paste it into your Webflow project, and hit publish. Tada!

After the slider gets published, we take care of the slider using our library that is injected into your slider.

In short, this is how the Goat slider works. Below we will walk step by step on how to create a slider.

    All the sliders must be created by the app. Otherwise, they will not work.

## Creating a Slider

Click the `New Slider` button to create a new slider. You will be prompted to enter a name for the slider and define the configurations of the wanted slider. After you have chosen your settings, click "Create", and whala! Your slider is ready to be pasted on your project.

## Editing the Design

Now that your slider is pasted onto your site, you can edit it as you want in the Webflow Designer. And use the app to change the functionality of it. Very few options are not editable after the slider is pasted. In those cases, a new slider needs to be created.

## Publishing

After you have finished editing your slider and adding your content, you can publish your site, and the slider will be live on your site. Congratulations, you have created your first Goat Slider. Now officially you are a üêê rider.
