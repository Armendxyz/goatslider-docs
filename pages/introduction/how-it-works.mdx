# How It Works

How it works is very simple, you get the app from Marketplace, open and create a customized slider based on your needs, and paste it into your Webflow project, then just publish that. Tada!

Then when the slider is published, we take care of the slider using a custom script. So this is basically all in short how it works. Below we will walk step by step on how to create a slider.

    All the sliders must be created by the app; otherwise, they will not work.

## Installing Goat Slider

Before anything else, we need to install the app from the Webflow Marketplace. So it will show up on your project/s. We recommend installing it on all workspaces so you can have the app anywhere you go.

Install the app from the Webflow Marketplace here.

## Opening the App

After installing it, you will be able to find the app in the Extensions section. Click 'launch', and that is what takes you inside the Goat Slider app. Now it's time to create your first slider.


## Creating a Slider

Now let's click the 'Create Slider' button to create a new slider. You will be prompted to enter a name for the slider, and a lot of configurations will be available to you on how you want to customize the slider.

After you have chosen your settings, click "Create", and whala! Your slider is ready to be pasted on your project.

## Editing the Design

Now that your slider is pasted onto your site, you can edit it as you want, as long as you don't break or leave the default layout it comes with. So you don't leave the root layout, but you can structure everything else in children as much as you want.

## Publishing

After you have finished editing your slider, you can publish your site, and the slider will be live on your site. Congratulations, you have created your first Goat Slider. Now officialy you are a üêê user.
