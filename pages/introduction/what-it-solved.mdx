# What It Solved

In Webflow, there were several issues, or limitations, better to say, when creating sliders. Some of those issues are listed below, explaining why we believe our app is better.

## No Customization

In Webflow, you don't have the flexibility to edit the points, arrows, and other elements of the slider. They are predefined or limited to use only a set of styles and states. However, with our app, this is not an issue. You have the flexibility to manage them in whatever way you want. For example, you can include videos on the dot points, and the sky is the limit. This applies to all elements we offer.

## Issues with Movements

The native slider has some issues with infinite loops and ending scenarios where the sliders are not continued correctly. We proudly have implemented a solution to fix this problem.

## Templates

Creating sliders is a pain in itself, it requires creativity and time. But we offer built-in slider templates for everyone to use, and we are extending it a lot. And we mean it. We offer both free and premium sliders for the community with never-seen animations and styles from the community.
