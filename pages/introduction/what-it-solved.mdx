# What It Solves

In the Webflow platform, there are several obstacles, or limitations, better to say, when creating sliders. Some of those issues are listed below, resembling the need why we developed the Goat Slider Webflow App.

## No Customization

In Webflow, you don't have the flexibility to edit the points, arrows, and other elements on the sliders. They are designed and predefined with limitations and there are just a set of styles and states. 

However, with our app, this is not an issue. You have the flexibility to manage them wherever you want. For example, you can include videos on the dot points, and the sky is the limit. This applies to all the elements we offer.

## Issues with Movements

The native slider has some issues with infinite loops and ending scenarios where the sliders are not continued correctly. We proudly have implemented a solution to fix this problem.

## Templates

Creating sliders is a pain in itself, it requires creativity and time. But we offer built-in slider templates for everyone to use, and we are extending it a lot. And we mean it. We offer both free and premium sliders for the community with never-seen animations and styles from the community.
